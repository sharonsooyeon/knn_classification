    "A feature function evaluates a name based on a certain feature of the name. For example, the `length` function counts the number of letters in a name, and the `hardCons` function counts the number of hard consonants in a name. Each feature can be thought of as a separate axis on an `n`-dimensional plane, where `n` = the number of features. Thus, each name can be plotted on this `n`-dimensional plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it is possible to distinguish male names from female ones based on the criteria that a feature function provides; this is what the computer learns to do given one or more feature functions and a set of training names. On a new set of test names, the k-NN classification algorithm works by taking the average gender of the closest `k` names for each test name. This is the predicted gender of the test name."

    "\n",
    "Here was my intuition for all of these functions:\n",
    "- `softCons`: the opposite of `hardCons`. If male names tend to have more hard consonants, would it be possible to say that female names have more soft consonants?\n",
    "- `consonants`: my intuition was that male names have more consonants in general than female names. This was a tricky one, though, since female names are longer. It might be the case that it is more useful to break this function down to either soft consonants or hard consonants, as we have done, but I thought I would give this one a shot anyway.\n",
    "- `softened_consonants`: male names have more hard consonants, but what if these hard consonants are softened with the letter \"h\" following it? Would it then make the name more feminine, since a hard consonant + h makes a softer sound than the hard consonant alone? All of these consonants make a softer sound when an \"h\" is added: \"c\" to \"ch\", \"p\" to \"ph\", \"s\" to \"sh\", and \"t\" to \"th\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`softCons` + `consonants` = 0.503<br>\n",
    "`softCons` + `softened_consonant` = 0.509<br>\n",
    "`softCons` + `softened_consonant` + `consonants` = 0.497\n",
    "\n",
    "`softCons` = 0.50<br>\n",
    "`consonants` = 0.50<br>\n",
    "`softened_consonant` = 0.497<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "My results are not very promising; all accuracies hover at around 0.50, which is equivalent to randomly guessing for each name. A lot of the intuition I gathered from the first pass through this assignment is encapsulated with the given functions; therefore, I am going to try experimenting with those (maybe also a combination of the given functions and my own functions) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available functions:\n",
    "- `length`\n",
    "- `vowels`\n",
    "- `hardCons`\n",
    "- `countLetters`\n",
    "- `lastLetter`\n",
    "- `firstLetter`\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these given functions are the most influential? I train and test each of these feature functions one by one."

    "`countLetters` seems to be the most influential, with an accuracy of 0.69. This makes sense because this particular function does not distill the characteristics of each name into a single digit; instead, it gives detailed information (letter by letter) about which letters are most frequently used. For example, there are many ways for both male and female names to have 3 vowels, but fewer ways for both male and female names to have a certain set of letters in common.\n",
